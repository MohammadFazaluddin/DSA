# 2 Dimenstional Arrays
- A 2-dimensional array is a collection of elements placed in **m** rows and **n** columns.
- The 2-dimensional array is also called a matrix.
- Rows and Columns of a matrix are only a matter of imagination. When a matrix gets stored in memory all its elements are stored linearly since computer's memory can only be viewed as consecutive units of memory locations.

## Class matrix
We have designed a class called **matrix**. This class contains function that perform different matrix operations like addition, multiplication, transposition, etc. 
The **create()** function creates a 2-D array containing 3 rows and 3 columns.
The **display()** function display the element of the matrix.
The function **matadd()** adds the elements of two matrixes **mat1.mat** and **mat2.mat**. The result is stored in matrix **mat** of the object mat3 that has called the **matadd()** function.
The function **matmul()** multiplies the elements of matrix **mat1.mat** and **mat2.mat** and store the result into the matrix **mat** of the object **mat4** that has called the function.
The function **transpose()**, transposes a matrix.
